This repo is a collection of pictures of awesome trees. Ideally timestamped and location pinned. 
The goal is to make a simple web app, or static HTML site, to explore those pictures across space and time.

# Vibe-coding Notes

### 2025-09-12 First tweaks and second round of photos

The section was vibe-coded (with Anthropic Claude 4, via Continue in VS Code) up through f79b0dabb2f6690df8ee1bdda8f1dfb4836b2823 ([0.1.0.8002](https://github.com/seth127/treepics/releases/tag/0.1.0.8002))

This went pretty well on the feature development, but there were some continuing struggles with the deployment to `gh-pages`. I finally got it working with this dumb commit. Haven't thought too hard about it, but the bot really struggled with that one.

Side note: `convert_photos.py` worked great when I added the new batch.
