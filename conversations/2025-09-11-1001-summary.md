## Conversation Summary

We successfully set up a Python project called `treepics-map` to create an interactive map from tree photographs with GPS metadata. Here's what we accomplished:

### Project Setup
- Created a Python project using `uv` with dependencies: `pillow`, `jinja2`, `pandas`, `pillow-heif`, `exifread`
- Fixed HEIC support by installing `libheif` via Homebrew and adding HEIC-compatible Python packages
- Project structure created with proper directories: `src/treepics_map/`, `photos/`, `templates/`, `static/`, `output/`

### Core Components Built
1. **`src/treepics_map/metadata_extractor.py`** - Extracts EXIF data (GPS coordinates, timestamps, camera info) from photos including HEIC files
2. **`src/treepics_map/static_site_generator.py`** - Generates static HTML site with interactive Leaflet.js map, clusters nearby photos, creates responsive design
3. **`main.py`** - CLI entry point with argument parsing for photos directory and output directory
4. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### Key Features Implemented
- EXIF metadata extraction from JPG, PNG, TIFF, and HEIC files
- GPS coordinate processing and geographic clustering
- Static HTML generation with interactive map using Leaflet.js
- Chronological photo viewing at each location
- Responsive design for desktop/mobile
- Photo modal for full-size viewing

### Current Status
- Project is ready for testing with actual photos
- HEIC file support is now working
- Need to add photos to `photos/` directory and run `uv run python main.py`
- Ready for first functional commit

### Next Steps
1. Test with actual HEIC photos from iPhone
2. Make first commit when basic functionality works
3. Refine UI/UX and add features as needed
4. Eventually publish to GitHub Pages
