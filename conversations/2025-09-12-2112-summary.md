# TreePics GitHub Pages Deployment Summary

## Overview
Successfully created and implemented a deployment script to publish a static site generated by the TreePics project to GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure
- **Main Project**: Located in `treepics-map/` directory
- **Site Generation**: Static site built by running `treepics-map/main.py`
- **Output Location**: Generated site stored in `treepics-map/output/site/`
- **Target Deployment**: GitHub Pages at `https://seth127.github.io/treepics`

## What We Built

### Deploy Script (`deploy.py`)
Created a comprehensive Python deployment script with the following features:

#### Core Functionality
- **Environment Validation**: Checks for git repository and source directory existence
- **Clean Working Directory Requirement**: Errors out if there are unstaged changes (no prompting)
- **Temporary Directory Strategy**: Copies site contents to temp directory before branch switching to avoid path issues
- **Branch Management**: Handles both new and existing `gh-pages` branches
- **Complete Site Replacement**: Wipes `gh-pages` branch clean and replaces with new site content
- **Automatic Git Operations**: Commits and pushes changes automatically

#### Safety Features
- Validates that `index.html` exists in source directory
- Ensures `index.html` is present at root level after deployment
- Provides clear error messages and progress feedback
- Switches back to original branch when complete
- Only commits if there are actual changes to deploy

## Deployment Process
1. **Generate Site**: Run `python treepics-map/main.py`
2. **Deploy Site**: Run `python deploy.py` (or `uv run deploy.py`)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Branch Strategy
- **Source Branch**: `pages-first-try` (contains the deploy script and project)
- **Deployment Branch**: `gh-pages` (serves the static site)
- **GitHub Pages Configuration**: Serves from root of `gh-pages` branch

### Key Technical Solutions
- **Path Resolution**: Used temporary directory to avoid cross-branch file path issues
- **Clean Deployment**: Complete wipe and replace strategy ensures no stale files
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and clear error messages
- **Idempotent**: Can be run multiple times safely

## Results
✅ Successfully deployed TreePics site to GitHub Pages  
✅ Site live at: `https://seth127.github.io/treepics`  
✅ `index.html` properly positioned at root level  
✅ All assets (CSS, JS, photos) correctly deployed  
✅ Clean, automated deployment workflow established  

## Files Created/Modified
- `deploy.py` - Main deployment script (189 lines)
- Multiple commits to refine and fix deployment logic
- Final deployment: 133 files deployed to `gh-pages` branch

## Usage Notes
- Script requires clean working directory (no unstaged changes)
- Uses `uv run` for Python execution
- Provides clear feedback throughout deployment process
- Automatically handles git operations (fetch, checkout, reset, commit, push)
