I would like to create a python project to explore pictures that I've taken of trees. I would like to manage the dependencies with uv.

Information to get us started:

* I have the pictures in my iPhone, in the Google photos app. I can upload them to a googledrive folder and use that API, if that's helpful. Or I can store them locally, either tracked or untracked in the repo.

* I want to import that metadata associated with the photos, that I can see on my iPhone. For example: the location of the picture, and the date and time it was taken. 

* I want to create an interactive app that lets the user view a map (with basic map app functionality, like zooming in and out, etc.) and icons which signify the location of the pictures of trees that I want to include. 

* The user should be able to click on one of these map icons, and then peruse the pictures of trees in that area, in chronological order.

* Ideally, this could be served as a static HTML site, so that I could eventually publish it on something like github pages. But we can handle the publishing in a later step. We could also write a simple web app for this, but I would like to try static HTML first, so that we don't need a server to host it.

* Please prompt me to make commits as reasonable points in time, when some aspect of the project has become functional. Please propose informative commit messages, but let me edit them before committing.

Thank you. Let's get started!
